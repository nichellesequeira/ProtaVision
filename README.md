## :pen: Introduction

This project is part of the Practical Programming in Chemistry course given at EPFL (spring semester 2024), with aim to familiriaze ourselves with using GitHub and collaborating on a programming project together.

## :paintbrush: Features

This package enables users to input two proteins from a dictionary and determine the number of matching amino acids, along with the indices of those that do not match. In essence, it facilitates sequence alignment, a fundamental principle in bioinformatics. 
### Main Features

- **Sequence Alignment**: Efficiently compare two protein sequences to identify matching and non-matching amino acids.
- **Amino Acid Analysis**: Analyze properties of amino acids, such as molecular weight and composition.
- **Substitutions Conservatrices**: Explore amino acid substitutions that preserve biochemical properties.
- **Protein Visualization**: Visualize protein structures in 3D using PDB codes.
- **Gap Method for Sequence Alignment**: Implement a gap-based sequence alignment method.

## :fire: Usage

```python
from mypackage import main_func

# One line to rule them all
result = main_func(data)
```

This usage example shows how to quickly leverage the package's main functionality with just one line of code (or a few lines of code). 
After importing the `main_func` (to be renamed by you), you simply pass in your `data` and get the `result` (this is just an example, your package might have other inputs and outputs). 
Short and sweet, but the real power lies in the detailed documentation.

## :computer: Installation

Create a new environment, you may also give the environment a different name. 

```
conda create -n protavision python=3.10 
```

```
conda activate protavision
(conda_env) $ pip install .
```

If you need jupyter lab, install it 

```
(protavision) $ pip install jupyterlab
```
This package also uses mulptiple external package. Normally, these have already been installed. To check if you have *biopython*, *py3Dmol*, *pandas*, & *matplotlib*, run:
```
(protavision) $ conda list
```
If you don't have them, please install it by running these commands in you terminal:
```
(protavision) $ pip install biopython
(protavision) $ pip install py3Dmol
(protavision) $ pip install pandas
(protavision) $ pip install matplotlib
```

## :hammer: Development installation

Initialize Git (only for the first time). 

Note: You should have create an empty repository on `https://github.com:nichellesequeira/ProtaVision`.

```
git init
git add * 
git add .*
git commit -m "Initial commit" 
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:nichellesequeira/ProtaVision.git 
git push -u origin main
```

Then add and commit changes as usual. 

To install the package, run

```
(protavision) $ pip install -e ".[test,doc]"
```

### Run tests and coverage

```
(conda_env) $ pip install tox
(conda_env) $ tox
```
