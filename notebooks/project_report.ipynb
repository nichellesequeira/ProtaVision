    "**About This Notebook:**\n",
    "This notebook is dedicated to facilitating sequence alignment, a fundamental principle in bioinformatics. Using a custom package, you can input two proteins from a dictionary and efficiently determine the number of matching amino acids, as well as identify the indices of those that do not match. Whether you're delving into bioinformatics for the first time or seeking a streamlined tool for protein analysis, this notebook provides a comprehensive solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Getting Started:**\n",
    "To get started, simply navigate through the sections using the table of contents provided on the ReadMe. Each section is packed with explanations, code snippets, and visualizations to help you grasp concepts effectively. \n",
    "NOTE: For this package, we use the biopython package. One can do this by typing \"pip install biopython\". Sometimes you can still encouter an error, in this case please use this piece of code before executing the code: !pip install biopython. The error occurs because it's possible that Jupyter Notebook is not using the same Python environment where Biopython is installed. Jupyter Notebook can use different Python environments, and sometimes the packages installed in one environment might not be available in another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Use:**\n",
    "Feel free to experiment with the code! Modify variables, tweak parameters, and run cells to see how different changes affect the outcomes. Don't hesitate to ask questions or seek clarification whenever needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Resources:**\n",
    "If you're new to Jupyter Notebooks or need a refresher, check out the [Jupyter Notebook Documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for comprehensive guidance.\n",

    "## Substitutions Conservatrices in Biochemistry Amino Acids\n",
    "\n",
    "In biochemistry, substitutions conservatrices refer to amino acid substitutions in protein sequences that preserve the physicochemical properties or functional roles of the amino acids involved. These substitutions maintain the structure and function of the protein despite alterations in the amino acid sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics:\n",
    "- **Conservation of Function**: Preserves biochemical properties or functional roles.\n",
    "- **Conservation of Structure**: Maintains structural integrity, especially in critical regions.\n",
    "- **Functional Redundancy**: Utilizes multiple amino acids with similar roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "- Aromatic Residues: Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan.\n",
    "- Hydrophobic Residues: Leucine, isoleucine, and valine.\n",
    "- Charge Conservation: Lysine and arginine, glutamate and aspartate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance:\n",
    "Understanding substitutions conservatrices predicts the effects of mutations on protein structure and function, aiding in informed hypotheses about protein behavior.\n",
