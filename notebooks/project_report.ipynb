    "Welcome to this interactive Jupyter Notebook! ðŸŽ‰\n",
    "\n",
    "**About This Notebook:**\n",
    "This notebook is dedicated to facilitating sequence alignment, a fundamental principle in bioinformatics. Using a custom package, you can input two proteins from a dictionary and efficiently determine the number of matching amino acids, as well as identify the indices of those that do not match. Whether you're delving into bioinformatics for the first time or seeking a streamlined tool for protein analysis, this notebook provides a comprehensive solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Getting Started:**\n",
    "To get started, simply navigate through the sections using the table of contents provided on the ReadMe. Each section is packed with explanations, code snippets, and visualizations to help you grasp concepts effectively. \n",
    "NOTE: For this package, we use the biopython package. One can do this by typing \"pip install biopython\". Sometimes you can still encouter an error, in this case please use this piece of code before executing the code: !pip install biopython. The error occurs because it's possible that Jupyter Notebook is not using the same Python environment where Biopython is installed. Jupyter Notebook can use different Python environments, and sometimes the packages installed in one environment might not be available in another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Use:**\n",
    "Feel free to experiment with the code! Modify variables, tweak parameters, and run cells to see how different changes affect the outcomes. Don't hesitate to ask questions or seek clarification whenever needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Resources:**\n",
    "If you're new to Jupyter Notebooks or need a refresher, check out the [Jupyter Notebook Documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for comprehensive guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions?**\n",
    "If you have any questions, please contact nichelle.sequeira@epfl.ch or aurelie.masson@epfl.ch\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's Dive In!**\n",

    "## Substitutions Conservatrices in Biochemistry Amino Acids\n",
    "\n",
    "In biochemistry, substitutions conservatrices refer to amino acid substitutions in protein sequences that preserve the physicochemical properties or functional roles of the amino acids involved. These substitutions maintain the structure and function of the protein despite alterations in the amino acid sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics:\n",
    "- **Conservation of Function**: Preserves biochemical properties or functional roles.\n",
    "- **Conservation of Structure**: Maintains structural integrity, especially in critical regions.\n",
    "- **Functional Redundancy**: Utilizes multiple amino acids with similar roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "- Aromatic Residues: Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan.\n",
    "- Hydrophobic Residues: Leucine, isoleucine, and valine.\n",
    "- Charge Conservation: Lysine and arginine, glutamate and aspartate.\n",

    "Understanding substitutions conservatrices predicts the effects of mutations on protein structure and function, aiding in informed hypotheses about protein behavior.\n",

    "# ProtaVision: Challenges and Features - General Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Protavision is an interactive Jupyter Notebook dedicated to exploring protein structures and functions!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequence Alignment**: Efficiently compare two protein sequences to identify matching and non-matching amino acids.\n",
    "- **Amino Acid Analysis**: Analyze properties of amino acids, such as molecular weight and composition.\n",
    "- **Substitutions Conservatrices**: Explore amino acid substitutions that preserve biochemical properties.\n",
    "- **Protein Visualization**: Visualize protein structures in 3D using PDB codes.\n",
    "- **Gap Method for Sequence Alignment**: Implement a gap-based sequence alignment method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges Encountered\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **PDB Retrieval**: Finding PDB codes for protein visualization posed a challenge, especially for proteins with no assigned PDB codes.\n",
    "2. **Sequence Alignment**: Writing code for sequence alignment, especially implementing the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, required careful consideration and debugging.\n",
    "3. **Package Compatibility**: Ensuring compatibility between different Python packages used in the notebook, such as Biopython and py3Dmol, sometimes resulted in compatibility issues.\n",
    "4. **User Input Handling**: Handling user input for gap-based sequence alignment involved validating inputs and error handling to ensure smooth execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Biopython**: Utilized for retrieving protein sequences from the UniProt database and performing sequence alignment.\n",
    "- **py3Dmol**: Used for visualizing protein structures in 3D within Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook**: Provided an interactive environment for running code, visualizing data, and documenting the analysis process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "ProtaVision offers a comprehensive toolkit for exploring protein structures and functions, overcoming challenges in sequence alignment, visualization, and analysis. With its intuitive interface and powerful functionalities, it serves as a valuable resource for bioinformatics enthusiasts and researchers alike.\n"
