    "### Grouping of the different amino acids that can be found in a protein\n",

    "This code is designed to read amino acid data from a text file and print out the details of each amino acid, including its name, single-letter code, three-letter code, and SMILES structure. The following steps outline the functionality of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Required Libraries**: The code uses the `os` and `ast` libraries. The `os` library is used for file path manipulations, and the `ast` library is used to safely evaluate a string containing a Python literal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Determine the Path to the Data File**: \n",
    "    - The current directory of the notebook is obtained using `os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath('__file__'))`.\n",
    "    - The project root directory is determined by navigating one level up from the current directory.\n",
    "    - The full path to the `aminoacids.txt` file is constructed by joining the project root with the `data` folder and the filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Read the Amino Acid Data from the File**:\n",
    "    - The file `aminoacids.txt` is opened and its content is read into a string variable.\n",
    "    - The data string is processed to extract the list part if it includes a variable assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Convert the String Data to a Python List**:\n",
    "    - The `ast.literal_eval` function is used to safely evaluate the string containing the list of amino acids and convert it into a Python list of dictionaries.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Print Amino Acid Details**:\n",
    "    - The code iterates over the list of amino acids.\n",
    "    - For each amino acid, it prints its name, single-letter code, three-letter code, and SMILES structure in a formatted manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is useful for processing and displaying biochemical data related to amino acids, making it easier to analyze and work with this information in a structured way."
