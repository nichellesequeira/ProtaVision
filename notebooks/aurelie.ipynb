    "## 📝Substitutions Conservatrices in Biochemistry Amino Acids\n",
    "\n",
    "In biochemistry, substitutions conservatrices refer to amino acid substitutions in protein sequences that preserve the physicochemical properties or functional roles of the amino acids involved. These substitutions maintain the structure and function of the protein despite alterations in the amino acid sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics:\n",
    "- **Conservation of Function**: Preserves biochemical properties or functional roles.\n",
    "- **Conservation of Structure**: Maintains structural integrity, especially in critical regions.\n",
    "- **Functional Redundancy**: Utilizes multiple amino acids with similar roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples📚:\n",
    "- Aromatic Residues: Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan.\n",
    "- Hydrophobic Residues: Leucine, isoleucine, and valine.\n",
    "- Charge Conservation: Lysine and arginine, glutamate and aspartate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance:\n",
    "Understanding substitutions conservatrices predicts the effects of mutations on protein structure and function, aiding in informed hypotheses about protein behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please make sure that your amino acid sequences are the same length to use this code, as without the same length, this code has no sense**\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to get the number of conservative substitutions thanks to the function **count_conservative_substitutions**.\n",

    "### 🔍 Counting Specific type of Amino Acids in Protein Sequences (hydrophobic, base...)\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook code snippet counts and displays the number of different types of amino acids in given protein sequences. The steps below outline the functionality of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Count Amino Acids in Protein Sequences**:\n",
    "    - The `count_amino_acids` function from the `functions` module is used to count the amino acids in the given protein sequences, `sequence1` and `sequence2`.\n",
    "    - The counts for `sequence1` are stored in `counts_1rsprotein`.\n",
    "    - The counts for `sequence2` are stored in `counts_2ndprotein`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Print Amino Acid Counts**:\n",
    "    - The code prints the protein sequence `sequence1`.\n",
    "    - It prints the number of hydrophobic, hydrophilic, acidic, and basic amino acids in `sequence1` using the counts stored in `counts_1rsprotein`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "If the sequences and the `count_amino_acids` function are properly defined, running this code will provide a detailed breakdown of the types of amino acids in the protein sequences. This is useful for analyzing the properties of proteins based on their amino acid composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a sequence \"MVHLTPEEK\", one would expect; \n",
    "- Number of hydrophobic amino acids: 3\n",
    "- Number of hydrophilic amino acids: 1\n",
    "- Number of acidic amino acids: 2 \n",
    "- Number of basic amino acids: 2\n"

    "## 🎉Protein Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Protein visualization is an essential aspect of structural biology and bioinformatics, allowing researchers to understand the three-dimensional structure and function of proteins. Interactive molecular visualization tools provide powerful capabilities for visualizing and analyzing protein structures directly within Jupyter Notebooks. Before visualizing the protein in 3D, we need to get the PDB name because we use a Python package named py3Dmol that needs the PDB name to visualize the protein in 3D. The first part of this section consists of converting the UniProt name (as an example in the form of MYG_HUMAN) into the PDB name (example: 3RGK).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output📚\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to see the protein structures in 3D and be able to zoom in/out and turn the protein around. It works by using the function named **unit_prot_to_pdb**. Please note that the code may not display the protein in 3D if it doesn't have a PDB code (this is what happens with the mouse myoglobin protein).\n"

    "## 💡Gap Method for Sequence Alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's move onto using the Gap Method. This code implements a simple sequence alignment method using a gap. Sequence alignment is a fundamental task in bioinformatics used to identify regions of similarity between DNA, RNA, or protein sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is useful for aligning and comparing sequences to identify similarities and differences between them. The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm ensures optimal global alignment, considering all possible alignments to maximize similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used for global pairwise sequence alignment. It compares two sequences by optimizing a scoring scheme that rewards matches and penalizes mismatches and gaps. By considering all possible alignments and choosing the one with the highest score, it identifies the optimal alignment, providing insights into the evolutionary relationships and functional similarities between the sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output📚\n",

    "For sequences defined as:\n",
    "- sequence1 = MYG_HUMAN\n",

The score is calculated by using the number of gaps of the protein with the function **calculate_number_of_gaps**.

    "\n",
    "## Motivations\n",
    "\n",
    "This package is useful for the students taking or interested by the biochemistry course. One can analyse 2 sequences, find the best method to get the more matches (sequence allignment and gaps). One can also try to see which secondary structure (alpha helices, beta structures, etc...) are present in the protein by visualizing the proteins in three dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequence Alignment**: Efficiently compare two protein sequences to identify matching and non-matching amino acids.\n",
    "- **Amino Acid Analysis**: Analyze properties of amino acids, such as molecular weight and composition.\n",
    "- **Substitutions Conservatrices**: Explore amino acid substitutions that preserve biochemical properties.\n",
    "- **Protein Visualization**: Visualize protein structures in 3D using PDB codes.\n",
    "- **Gap Method for Sequence Alignment**: Implement a gap-based sequence alignment method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges Encountered\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **PDB Retrieval**: Finding PDB codes for protein visualization posed a challenge, especially for proteins with no assigned PDB codes (as myoglobin for mouse for example).\n",
    "2. **Sequence Alignment**: Writing code for sequence alignment, especially implementing the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, required careful consideration and debugging.\n",
    "3. **Package Compatibility**: Ensuring compatibility between different Python packages used in the notebook, such as Biopython and py3Dmol, sometimes resulted in compatibility issues.\n",
    "4. **User Input Handling**: Handling user input for gap-based sequence alignment involves validating inputs and error handling to ensure smooth execution.\n",
    "5. **Using GitHub and handling conflicts**: We were having issues working on the notebook together and learning how to use multiple features such as pushing and pulling edits, dealing with environments and packages, dealing with README for the table of contents (links were not working)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools Used\n",
    "\n",
